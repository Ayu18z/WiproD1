//Q1: Write a Java program that:
//	- Create a text file essay.txt with multiple lines.
//	- Open the text file and read the file line by line.
//	- Counts the total number of words in the file.
//	- Writes the following information to a new file called report.txt:
//		Total number of lines: <number_of_lines>
//		Total number of words: <number_of_words>
//	- Closes both files properly
//	- Prints "Report generated successfully!" after writing.
//
//
//
//
//
//Q2: Write a Java program that:
//
//	- Reads the contents of two text files: file1.txt and file2.txt.
//	- Merges the content of both files alternating line by line (one line from file1.txt, then one from file2.txt).
//	- Writes the merged content to a new file called merged.txt.
//	- If one file has more lines than the other, the remaining lines from the longer file should be appended after the       	  alternating lines.
//	- Prints "Merge completed successfully!" once done.
//
//Q3: Write a Java program that demonstrates the Serialization and Deserialization process. The program should:
//- Define a Person class with two fields: name (String) and age (int).
//- Serialize an object of the Person class to a file (person. ser) .
//- Deserialize the object from the file (person. ser) and print its data (name and age) to the console.
